Faceted navigation filter for collection or contentlisting tiles.

This Plone 5 addon allows you to filter listing results for fields which are indexed in the catalog
(Plones internal search tool).
For example, you can add a subject filter, but also a filter for authors or portal types.

The filter types can be extended (see: ``collective.collectionfilter.vocabularies``).

There are three portlets/tiles available for filtering:

``Collection Filter``
    a list with values (select, radio, checkbox, link) you can filter on
``Collection Search``
    a SearchableText input field to do a fulltextsearch on the collection results
``Collection Maps``
    a LeafletJS map which shows and filters ``IGeolocatable`` items on it
    (this feature is available if ``collective.geolocationbehavior`` is installed and the behavior
    is activated on a contenttype. See installation notes below)
``Collection Result Listing Sort``
    a list of indexes where the user can sort the filtered result listing


Filter Results of Collections
-----------------------------

Add as many filter/search portlets directly to a collection.

When you select values from the filter the results are loaded asynchronously onto the page (no page refresh).
Unless you turn off ajax loading in the registry or are using Plone 5.0. If you are using special theme or view template
you can customize ``Content Selector`` and/or ```View Template``` to ensure ajax loading works correctly.
Make sure the selector exists on the source collection template and on the target page which shows the filtered results.

It is also possible to use filter portlets that aren't directly on a collection by specifying a target collection.
To use ajax loading you will need to ensure your content selector is visible on the page. If not using ajax loading selecting a filter
option will redirect you to the collection.


Mosaic Integration
------------------

Use the package extra to install the required dependencies::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs +=
        collective.collectionfilter[mosaic]
    ...

The three tiles can be added within the Mosaic editor multiple times. Just select them in the ``Insert`` menu
and assign a collection to it. To show the results of the collection simply add a
``Content Listing`` tile.

It's possible to use multiple content listings and multiple filters on the same page by specifying additional unique classes in
the listing tiles settings and then adding these classes to the ``Content Selector`` setting of the filter tile.

If you want to use filter tiles with a collection then add a content listing tile with the setting to use the query from the context.
It is also possible to use the ``Embed content`` tile if there is a unique selector on your collection view.



Geolocation filter support
--------------------------

If ``collective.geolocationbehavior`` is installed, this package provides a LeafletJS Maps tile/portlet
which shows each item of a collection result if the ``IGeolocatable`` information is available.
In addition you can activate the ``Narrow down results`` checkbox to narrow down the collection result and
other available filter tiles/portlets if the user moves or zooms the map.

We provide a package extra to install all required dependencies with their according versions.
Simply do this somewhere in your buildout::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs +=
        collective.collectionfilter[geolocation]
    ...


Overloading GroupByCriteria
---------------------------

``collective.collectionfilter.vocabularies.GroupByCriteria`` is a singleton, registered as global utility and used to provide a list of possible indices, which grouped values will provide your filter criteria.

It uses a data structure like this::

    self._groupby = {
        it: {                   # Index name
            'index': it,             # Name of the index to use
            'metadata': it,          # Name of the metadata column to use
            'display_modifier': _ ,  # Function to prepare the metadata column value for displaying
            'index_modifier': None,  # Function to transform the index search value.
            'value_blacklist': [],   # Blacklist of index values, which should not included in the filter selection. Can be a callable.
            'sort_key_function': lambda it: it['title'].lower(),  # sort key function. defaults to a lower-cased title
        }
        for it in metadata
    }

As you can see, the standard GroupByCriteriaVocabulary implementation implies, that the index name is the same as the metadata column name.
Also, we use the ``collective.collectionfilter`` message catalog as standard display_modifier (you can register translations under the ``collective.collectionfilter`` domain to translate index values).

If you need a special ``display_modifier``, or index or metadata columns do not have the same identifier, you can modify this data structure.
For that, register an adapter for ``IGroupByModifier``, which adapts to the GroupByCriteria utility.
Within this adapter, you can modify the already populated ``_groupby`` attribute (do not use the ``groupby``, which is a property method and at this point hasn't finished).

This is how.

Write an adapter::

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    from collective.collectionfilter.interfaces import IGroupByCriteria
    from collective.collectionfilter.interfaces import IGroupByModifier
    from zope.component import adapter
    from zope.interface import implementer


    sort_map = {
        'VALUE1': 3,
        'VALUE2': 1,
        'VALUE3': 2,
    }


    def subjectsort(it):
        # Sorts the value after a fixed sort map
        val = it['title']
        return sort_map.get(val, 0)


    @implementer(IGroupByModifier)
    @adapter(IGroupByCriteria)
    def groupby_modifier(groupby):
        groupby._groupby['Subject']['display_modifier'] = lambda x, idx: x.upper()
        groupby._groupby['Subject']['sort_key_function'] = subjectsort
        groupby._groupby['my_new_index'] = {
            'index': 'my_new_index',
            'metadata': 'my_new_index_metadata_colum',
            'display_modifier': lambda it, idx: u'this is awesome: {0}'.format(it)
        }

Register the adapter::

    <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope">
      <adapter factory=".collectionfilter.groupby_modifier" name="modifier_1" />
    </configure>

Done.

Your adapter is called by ``collective.collectionfilter.vocabularies.GroupByCriteria.groupby``.

Compatibility
-------------

- Version 5.x is compatible with Plone 6.x+
- Version 4.x is compatible with Plone 5.2+
- Version 3.x is compatible with Plone 5.0.x and 5.1.x

If your theme doesn't work well with AJAX loading this can be overridden in the registry or via diazo.

Changelog
=========

2.0 (unreleased)
----------------

Breaking changes:

- Remove the ``cache_time`` setting and replace it with ``cache_enabled``.
- Depend on Products.CMFPlone >= 5.1 for using ``get_top_request``.
- collectionsearch.pt: changed view attribute ``header_title`` to ``title``.

- Depend on plone.app.contenttypes.
  All target collections must provide ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.collection.ICollection`` interface.
  The ``result`` method will be callend on this behavior adapter.

- There is a implicit dependency to Font Awesome for the filter tile edit links.
  That has to be revisited to make it work out of the box.

- Modernized markup for easier styling

New:

- Optimize the cache key by including the current language, user roles instead of id and the database counter.

- Remove the view_name part when populating the browser history with filter changes.
  The view_name part is for loading specific AJAX tiles, but should probably not be displayed.

- Add filter and search tiles.

- Add a ``sort_key_function`` key to the IQueryModifier dict to allow for a different sort key function when sorting the values.

- Add a ``index_modifier`` key to the IQueryModifier indexes dict to allow transforming of index search values.
  For ``KeywordIndex`` indices the index_modifier is automatically set to encode the value to utf-8.

- Add a ``value_blacklist`` key to the IQueryModifier indexes dict to allow blacklisting of individual index values.

- Add ``view_name`` configuration parameter to call a special result listing view.
  This can be used to call a tile instead to call the whole context view.

- Add ``content_selector`` configuration parameter to choose a DOM node from the source to inject into the target.

- Ensure early exit on the content filter traverse handler if it is not needed to run.

Bug fixes:

- When reloading the collection in JavaScript, use the content selector's parent as base to trigger events on.
  The content selector itself is replaced and events cannot be catched.

- Register the bundle compile files as ``collectionfilter-bundle-compiled.js`` and ``collectionfilter-bundle-compiled.css``, so that using ``plone-compile-resources`` results in the same files.
  See: https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/2437

- Sort the filter value list for filter title instead filter value.

- fix collectionsearch portlet

- when providing a custom `IGroupByCriteria` adapter, fallback to title sorted values if no sort_key_function is given.
